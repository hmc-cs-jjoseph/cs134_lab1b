About this submission:
This submission meets all the specifications listed in the assignment (to the best of my understanding).
	- Regarding exit status:
		- Although I believe I wrote the code to make EOF from shell or SIGPIPE exit 2, my program always seems to get a SIGCHLD first.
		- Normal shell exit also sends a SIGCHLD, so my program pretty much always exits 0.
		- I also tried killing the shell from a separate bash session, but tht's the same as sending a SIGINT through my program
